### Tetrahedron and Euclidean Distance Based Decentralized Relative Localization for Multi-Robot Systems

This repository contains code for a multi-robot system localizer that uses euclidian distances and a tetrahedral sensor structure, as described in the paper "Tetrahedron and Euclidean Distance Based Decentralized Relative Localization for Multi-Robot Systems" by Yogesh Phalak and Dr. Shital Chiddarwar, which was published in the proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Innovation in Technology (INOCON) Bangaluru, India 2020.
